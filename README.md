I’m a passionate **backend developer** skilled in [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en), [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/), [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/), [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), and [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/).  

In 2024, I built [ScireAI](https://github.com/pranitmalhotra/ScireAI), a generative AI app streamlining research for students and professionals. My work focuses on developing scalable backend systems, integrating advanced APIs, and delivering impactful product experiences.  

I gained valuable industry experience during my internships. At [MyGate](https://mygate.com/), I contributed to their **Ads platform**, designing backend systems for targeted ad delivery, scalability, and performance optimization in high-traffic environments. Earlier, at [BalkanID](https://www.balkan.id/) and [ConverseNow AI](https://conversenow.ai/), I further developed my expertise in building secure and efficient backend solutions.  

Currently, I’m exploring **system design** and **scalable architectures** while seeking **internships and full-time opportunities**. Connect with me at **pranitmalhotra7@gmail.com** or explore my projects here.
