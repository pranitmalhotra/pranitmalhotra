I'm a passionate backend developer with expertise in [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en), [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/), [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/), [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), and [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/).

In 2024, I built [ScireAI](https://github.com/pranitmalhotra/ScireAI), a generative AI application designed to streamline the research process for students and professionals. I have experience developing scalable backend systems and integrating advanced APIs, focusing on delivering impactful product interactions.

At [MyGate](https://mygate.com/), I was an integral part of their ads platform, contributing to the design and development of backend systems that powered targeted ad delivery, ensured scalability, and optimized performance. This role allowed me to gain hands-on experience building secure, efficient, and production-grade solutions for high-traffic environments.

Previously, I gained valuable experience through internships at [BalkanID](https://www.balkan.id/) and [ConverseNow AI](https://conversenow.ai/), where I further honed my backend development skills.

I'm currently diving deeper into system design, distributed systems, and scalable architectures, while exploring new tools and frameworks to enhance my skill set.

P.S. Iâ€™m actively seeking **internships and full-time opportunities** where I can grow and contribute. Feel free to connect with me at pranitmalhotra7@gmail.com or check out my projects here!
